The goal of this series of articles is to arrive at an acceptable setup for doing
FreeBSD kernel development and auditing, while using my Arch Linux setup as main operating system.

My "vision":

* Compiler VM which is tasked with building the kernel and holding the source code

* Diskless target VM which is then used for debugging, which mounts NFS shares provided by the compiler for storage, and which can then crash without risking corrupting anything.

* Arch Linux host using QEMU for the VMs, that also mounts the NFS share containing the source code. On this machine, I want to use a cross-compiled GDB, which I can then attach to the target VM to do source level debugging.

In the coming articles, I will describe my way to arrive at that setup as I go along, so please do not expect this to be a definitive guide.
