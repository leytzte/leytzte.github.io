This post continues where we left things after the last post and will talk
about getting the most current source code as well as setting up PXE booting.

# Prerequisites
* The VM & network setup of the previous post

# Part 1: Getting the source

The source code is made available in a SVN-Repository, so we need to install svn
to be able to check it out.

{% highlight shell %}
pkg install subversion
{% endhighlight %}

And then create a directory like `/source/freebsd-current` and check out the source code into it
(this might take a while...)

{% highlight shell %}
svn checkout https://svn.freebsd.org/base/head/ /source/freebsd-current
{% endhighlight %}

# Part 2: SSHFS to access the source code from the host

Setting up SSHFS is easy, just create a folder (I called mine `source`) as mountpoint on the host, and then do

{% highlight shell %}
sshfs compiler:/source source
{% endhighlight %}

When you want to unmount, just do:

{% highlight shell %}
fusermount -u source
{% endhighlight %}

# Part 3: Setting up NFS and TFTP

Now, we will set up a directory that will hold the root of our target VM,
and offer this as a NFS share to boot from.
This somewhat follows the FreeBSD manual for 
[Diskless Operation with PXE](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/network-diskless.html),
but there are a few changes.

Add a new user to let the target machine write files on the host later, I called mine `target`.

{% highlight shell %}
export NFSROOTDIR=/target/tftpboot/FreeBSD/install
mkdir -p ${NFSROOTDIR}
mkdir -p /target/writable/root
chown -R target:target /target/writable
{% endhighlight %} 

**Optional:** You could add this export to your `.zshrc` to have it always available.

Enable the NFS server as well as `inetd` in `/etc/rc.conf` by adding:

{% highlight shell %}
nfs_server_enable="YES"
inetd_enable="YES"
{% endhighlight %}

Add the directory to be shared to `/etc/exports`

{% highlight shell %}
/target -ro -alldirs -mapall=target 192.168.0.2
{% endhighlight %}

Enable TFTP by uncommenting and editing the following line in `/etc/inetd.conf`:

{% highlight shell %}
tftp dgram udp wait root /usr/libexec/tftpd tftpd -l -s /target/tftpboot
{% endhighlight %}

and then starting the servers via

{% highlight shell %}
service nfsd start
service inetd start
{% endhighlight %}

# Part 4: Building FreeBSD from source and installing it

{% highlight shell %}
cd /source/freebsd-current
make buildworld buildkernel
{% endhighlight %}

This will take a while, on my laptop *hours*. After that, do:

{% highlight shell %}
make installworld installkernel distribution DESTDIR=${NFSROOTDIR}
{% endhighlight %}

Create the new installation's `/etc/fstab`, at `${NFSROOTDIR}/etc/fstab`

{% highlight shell %}
# Device                                         Mountpoint    FSType   Options  Dump Pass
192.168.0.1:/target/tftpboot/FreeBSD/install       /            nfs     ro       0    0
192.168.0.1:/target/writable/root                  /root        nfs     rw       0    0
{% endhighlight %}

The second line gives us a persistent root folder for the target machine, stored on the compiler VM.

Now, we need to copy and modify a few configuration files

* Copy `/etc/resolv.conf` to the target
* create a new `/etc/rc.conf` on it containing 

{% highlight shell %}
hostname="target"
ifconfig_vtnet0="inet 192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0"
defaultrouter="192.168.0.100"
sshd_enable="YES"
# Set dumpdev to "AUTO" to enable crash dumps, "NO" to disable
dumpdev="AUTO"
{% endhighlight %}

* copy your ssh public key to the `/target/writable/root` directory
* copy your  `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to `${NFSROOTDIR}/etc/ssh` and add `StrictModes off` (this is because
our nfs squashing to the user `target` leads to broken ownership in the root directory. 

* Then `chroot` into it, start networking and set the root password,
generate ssh keys, install packages you want. Then, create compressed archives of
`/etc` and `/var`:

{% highlight shell %}
chroot ${NFSROOTDIR} /bin/csh
/etc/rc.d/routing restart
passwd
ssh-keygen -A

# install your packages now

# create compressed versions of /etc and /var to be used for memory filesystems
mkdir -p /conf/base/etc
tar -c -v -f conf/base/etc.cpio.gz --format cpio --gzip etc
tar -c -v -f conf/base/var.cpio.gz --format cpio --gzip var

# Adjust the size of the filesystems in RAM
echo "256M" > /conf/base/etc/md_size
echo "256M" > /conf/base/var/md_size
{% endhighlight %}


The `/bin/csh` parameter is necessary if your shell is not included in a default FreeBSD installation.

The two `tar` commands have to be rerun when you make any changes to the target system that
affect `/etc` or `/var`, like installing packages, changing configuration files, etc.

# Part 5: DHCP-Server setup

First, install the `net/isc-dhcp43-server` package, and then edit the config in `/usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf` to the following.

{% highlight shell %}
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;
authoritative;
log-facility local0;

subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    range 192.168.0.2 192.168.0.10;
    
    option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
    option routers 192.168.0.100;
    option broadcast-address 192.168.0.255;
    option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4;
    
    next-server 192.168.0.1;
    filename "FreeBSD/install/boot/pxeboot";
    option root-path "192.168.0.1:/target/tftpboot/FreeBSD/install/";

    host target {
        hardware ethernet ca:fe:ca:fe:ca:fe;
        fixed-address 192.168.0.2;
    }    

}
{% endhighlight %}

add `dhcpd_enable="YES"` as well as `dhcpd_chuser_enable="YES"` to `/etc/rc.conf` and start the service via `service isc-dhcpd start`.

# Part 6: Booting the target VM

{% highlight shell %}
qemu-system-x86_64 -boot n -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=mynet0,mac=CA:FE:CA:FE:CA:FE -netdev tap,id=mynet0,ifname=VMTap1,script=no,downscript=no,vhost=on -m 4096 -enable-kvm -smp 2
{% endhighlight %}

# Part X: Troubleshoting
Wireshark is an invaluable help to figure out what goes wrong during the PXE.

Problems I encountered:
* Both VMs having the same MAC address
* Different IP addresses being assigned between PXE Boot and FreeBSD's loader, which caused it to ignore the DHCP reply that indicated the root location
* Forgetting to recreate the `conf/base/*.cpio.gz` files
